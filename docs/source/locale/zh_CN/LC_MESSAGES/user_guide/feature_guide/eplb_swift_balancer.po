"Expert balancing for MoE models in LLM serving is essential for optimal "
"performance. Dynamically changing experts during inference can negatively"
" impact TTFT (Time To First Token) and TPOT (Time Per Output Token) due "
"to stop-the-world operations. SwiftBalancer enables asynchronous expert "
"load balancing with zero-overhead expert movement, ensuring seamless "
