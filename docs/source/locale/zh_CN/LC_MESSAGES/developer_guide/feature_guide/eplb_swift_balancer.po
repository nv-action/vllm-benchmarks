"When using Expert Parallelism (EP), different experts are assigned to "
"different NPUs. Given that the load of various experts may vary depending"
" on the current workload, it is crucial to maintain balanced loads across"
" different NPUs. We adopt a redundant experts strategy by duplicating "
"heavily-loaded experts. Then, we heuristically pack these duplicated "
"experts onto NPUs to ensure load balancing across them. Moreover, thanks "
"to the group-limited expert routing used in MoE models, we also attempt "
"to place experts of the same group on the same node to reduce inter-node "
"data traffic, whenever possible."

"To facilitate reproduction and deployment, Vllm Ascend supported deployed"
" EP load balancing algorithm in `vllm_ascend/eplb/core/policy`. The "
"algorithm computes a balanced expert replication and placement plan based"
" on the estimated expert loads. Note that the exact method for predicting"
" expert loads is outside the scope of this repository. A common method is"
" to use a moving average of historical statistics."
