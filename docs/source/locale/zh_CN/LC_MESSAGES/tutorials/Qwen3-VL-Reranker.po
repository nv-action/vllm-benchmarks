"The Qwen3-VL-Embedding and Qwen3-VL-Reranker model series are the latest "
"additions to the Qwen family, built upon the recently open-sourced and "
"powerful Qwen3-VL foundation model. Specifically designed for multimodal "
"information retrieval and cross-modal understanding, this suite accepts "
"diverse inputs including text, images, screenshots, and videos, as well "
"as inputs containing a mixture of these modalities. This guide describes "
"how to run the model with vLLM Ascend."
