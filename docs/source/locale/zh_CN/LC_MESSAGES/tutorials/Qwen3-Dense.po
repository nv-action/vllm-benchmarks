msgid ""
"Setting the right prefetch buffer size is essential for optimizing weight"
" loading and the size of this prefetch buffer is directly related to the "
"time that can be hidden by vector computations. To achieve a near-perfect"
" overlap between the prefetch and computation streams, you can flexibly "
"adjust the buffer size by profiling and observing the degree of overlap "
"at different buffer sizes."

"For example, in the real-world scenario mentioned above, I set the "
"prefetch buffer size for the gate_up_proj and down_proj in the MLP to "
"18MB. The reason for this is that, at this value, the vector computations"
" of RMSNorm and SiLU can effectively hide the prefetch stream, thereby "
"accelerating the Matmul computations of the two linear layers."

"The max-num-batched-tokens parameter determines the maximum number of "
"tokens that can be processed in a single batch. Adjusting this value "
"helps to balance throughput and memory usage. Setting this value too "
"small can negatively impact end-to-end performance, as fewer tokens are "
"processed per batch, potentially leading to inefficiencies. Conversely, "
"setting it too large increases the risk of Out of Memory (OOM) errors due"
" to excessive memory consumption."

"In the above real-world scenario, we not only conducted extensive testing"
" to determine the most cost-effective value, but also took into account "
"the accumulation of decode tokens when enabling chunked prefill. If the "
"value is set too small, a single request may be chunked multiple times, "
"and during the early stages of inference, a batch may contain only a "
"small number of decode tokens. This can result in the end-to-end "
"throughput falling short of expectations."

"The cudagraph_capture_sizes parameter controls the granularity of graph "

"If this list is not manually specified, it will be filled with a series "
"of evenly distributed values, which typically ensures good performance. "
"However, if you want to fine-tune it further, manually specifying the "
"values will yield better results. This is because if the batch size falls"
" between two sizes, the framework will automatically pad the token count "
"to the larger size. This often leads to actual performance deviating from"
" the expected or even degrading."

"Therefore, like the above real-world scenario, when adjusting the "
"benchmark request concurrency, we always ensure that the concurrency is "
"actually included in the cudagraph_capture_sizes list. This way, during "
"the decode phase, padding operations are essentially avoided, ensuring "
"the reliability of the experimental data."
