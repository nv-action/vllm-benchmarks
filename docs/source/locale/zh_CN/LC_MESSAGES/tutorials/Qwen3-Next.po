"The Qwen3-Next model is a sparse MoE (Mixture of Experts) model with high"
" sparsity. Compared to the MoE architecture of Qwen3, it has introduced "
"key improvements in aspects such as the hybrid attention mechanism and "
"multi-token prediction mechanism, enhancing the training and inference "
"efficiency of the model under long contexts and large total parameter "
"scales."

"performance related to stability and accuracy may change, and performance"
" will be continuously optimized."
